# NodeJS & SQLite - Headstart

Based on "Build a REST API with Node.js SQLite and Express JS" at https://developerhowto.com/2018/12/29/build-a-rest-api-with-node-js-and-express-js/

In this guide you can build a REST API with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) SQLite and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). Then, in a next part, we will be building automated Unit tests using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/), ready for a Test-Driven Development (TDD).

The main components of this REST service are:

- A Node.js base project, created as a NPM module
- An Express.js web server to manage the API endpoints, requests and responses
- A SQLite database for application storage
